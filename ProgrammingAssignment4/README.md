# Peer-graded Assignment "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project"
This GitHub repository contains the submission Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It contains the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition Using Smartphones dataset (dated 12/9/2012).

## Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

## Files
codebook.md is thecode book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

TidyData.txt is the exported data after going through all the sequences described above.
